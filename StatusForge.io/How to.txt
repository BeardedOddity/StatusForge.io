Install Dependencies
Activate your virtual environment and install the required libraries:

Bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note for Linux users: The Scout requires xdotool to track active windows. Run sudo apt install xdotool if you don't already have it).

Step 3: Secure Your Config
Locate Config_Template.json in the main folder.

Rename it to exactly Config.json.

Open it in any text editor and paste in your API keys for RAWG, SteamGridDB, and IGDB (Client ID & Secret).

Don't have API keys? The engine will automatically fall back to scraping GOG.com, but having keys ensures a 99% hit rate for obscure titles.

🎮 Booting the Engine & Using the Dashboard
To start the engine, simply double-click Launch StatusForge.vbs (Windows) or run ./Launch StatusForge.sh (Mac/Linux). The engine will boot completely silently in the background.


From the Dashboard, you can:

Monitor the Scout: See exactly what game is detected, how long you've been playing, and what art the Waterfall grabbed.

Generate Browser Source Widgets: Grab secure, token-protected URLs to paste directly into your OBS Browser Sources.

Manage The Vault: Rename tracked .exe files, manually override cover art URLs, or permanently banish background apps from being scanned.

View Live Logs: A built-in terminal to watch the engine's real-time decision-making.

🎥 Broadcast software & Streamer.bot Integration
Setting up Browser Source Widgets
On the Dashboard, click the "Generate Local Widget" button.

Select your preferred layout (Vertical, Horizontal Left, etc.).

Copy the secure URL provided.

In Meld studios, OBS or any other broadcast software add a new Browser Source, paste the URL, set the dimensions (usually 600x900 or 1000x400 depending on the widget), and check "Refresh browser when scene becomes active."

Auto-Pushing to Streamer.bot
StatusForge can automatically update your Twitch/Kick category when you launch a new game.

Open your Config.json (or use the Dashboard settings).

Set auto_push to true.

Ensure your Streamer.bot HTTP Server is running on the port specified in your settings (default is 8080).

StatusForge will now send a payload to Streamer.bot requesting an UpdateCategory action whenever your game changes!

🛑 Shutting Down & Maintenance
To shut down: Because StatusForge runs silently, you must click the red SHUT DOWN button on the bottom left of the Master Dashboard to safely kill the background process.

Maintenance: If an update breaks a dependency, click the "Run System Repair" button on the Dashboard. The engine will automatically attempt to reinstall missing Python libraries and OS dependencies.
